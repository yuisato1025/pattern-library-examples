# PATTERN LIBRARY EXAMPLES

## Motivation

When it comes to create design system for a product, I learned that you need a library of user interface (UI) patterns that designers and design teams use to build, and developers refer to it, which is called pattern library.
There are a few ways to create it, so I just want to make it clear that each approach"s pro and cons by comparing them.

## Result

TBD
